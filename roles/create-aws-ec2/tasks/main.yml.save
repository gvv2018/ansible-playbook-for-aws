# tasks file for create-aws-ec2
Once your nodes are spun up, you’ll probably want to talk to them again. With a cloud setup, it’s best to not maintain a static list of cloud hostnames in text files. Rather, the best way to handle this is to use the ec2 dynamic inventory script. See Working With Dynamic Inventory.

This will also dynamically select nodes that were even created outside of Ansible, and allow Ansible to manage them.

See Working With Dynamic Inventory for how to use this, then return to this chapter.
